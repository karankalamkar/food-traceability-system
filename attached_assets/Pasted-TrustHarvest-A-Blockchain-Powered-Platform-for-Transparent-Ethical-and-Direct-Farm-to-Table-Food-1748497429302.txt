TrustHarvest ‚Äì A Blockchain-Powered Platform for Transparent, Ethical, and Direct Farm-to-Table Food Traceability

üß© Problem Statement:
Design a blockchain-based web or mobile application that ensures secure, transparent, and verifiable traceability of food from farm to fork. The system should strengthen market linkages, enable direct farmer-consumer interaction, and guarantee ethical sourcing and product quality. This platform should empower every actor in the agricultural value chain‚ÄîFarmers, Processors, Suppliers, Retailers, and Consumers‚Äîby providing role-specific dashboards and functionalities.

üõ†Ô∏è Prompt Description:
TrustHarvest is a multi-role blockchain solution that provides end-to-end traceability of food products using QR codes, smart contracts, and decentralized data storage. Each user role‚ÄîFarmer, Processor, Supplier, Retailer, and Consumer‚Äîhas a dedicated login with tailored capabilities.

Farmers can upload their profile, farm certifications, pesticide usage, and a short video showcasing the product and their story. They can also generate QR codes for each product batch, track crop-related expenses, and geo-tag their farm location for authenticity. Consumers can scan the QR code to trace the product‚Äôs entire journey, view the farmer‚Äôs video, and interact with the producer. They can also provide star ratings and order products directly from the farmer based on transparency, grade, and reviews.

Processors can scan the QR, review detailed product history, and classify goods into Grade A1 (for direct consumption) and Grade B1 (for processing), with the ability to transparently fix prices. These decisions are stored on the blockchain using smart contracts for immutable verification and rate finalization, enabling farmers to receive instant pricing updates.

Suppliers update transport and storage details such as vehicle info, route, timestamps, and packaging conditions‚Äîall logged securely on-chain to ensure trust. Retailers verify product integrity, flag compromised batches, and help consumers confirm origin, safety, and authenticity.

Consumers play a crucial role by rating products and farmers, interacting directly with growers, and making purchases from verified ethical sources. Their feedback is stored transparently to build a consumer-farmer trust bridge, enhanced with real stories through video proof.

The system includes advanced features such as transparent pricing and grading, blockchain-logged product verification, and multi-language support to empower local users. Real-time alerts notify users about price updates, feedback, or order status. A blockchain-based micro-payment system can enable secure, direct payments, and smart contracts help reduce middleman dependencies.

Additional features include a Green Score to track sustainability metrics (like pesticide use and food miles), an AI-based grading and crop health assistant, and an integrated GST/invoice generator for compliant transactions. Farmers and consumers can view dashboards with analytics like expense-to-profit comparisons, sales insights, and rating history. The built-in marketplace allows filtering by grade, distance, seasonality, and ratings, while a community voting system highlights top-performing farmers.

The solution is scalable and ready for rural implementation with offline data sync, ensuring inclusivity. QR codes allow real-time scanning and traceability at every step. With full decentralization, TrustHarvest eliminates information opacity and brings trust, fairness, and empowerment across the agri-value chain.
